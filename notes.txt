---- ls -> list files
---- cd -> change directory
---- *command* & -> multithread (allow for use of console while in emacs)
---- ctrl-c -> close what working on
---- sftp *target@computername* -> "Secure file transfer protocol"
---- get *filename* -> take file from that computer and copy it to your computer
---- filename cheat: *partofFile*.pdf -> asterisks are wildcards and it gets any file that
     includes "partofFile" and ends in .pdf
---- cc -> call c compiler
---- gcc -o *name* *fileName* -> set a.out to be *name*
---- cc -lm -lX11 ->  "-lm" => link to math  "-lX11" => link to linux graphical library.
---- gcc -o *CompiledFileName* *FiletoCompile.c* -lm -lX11 -> use all stuff before and make
     it work for graphical things
---- gcc -O (capital O, makes the compiler optimize the code)
---- fg creates a whole bunch of files that are different steps of the compiler.

Functions and Parameter Passing in C:
--Functions pass copies of values inherently (as expected, methods cannot directly
  edit main program variables.
  --CAREFUL: Arrays break this. AND ONLY ARRAYS (because methods send memory location of
    initial part of array. In methods, always make copies of the arrays if you don't
    want to change them.
--Arrays don't have a .length, that is why G_polygon needs the number of items.
