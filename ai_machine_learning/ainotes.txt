Python Things
- Import basically copy pastes the file imported into the line of the import statement
- " if __name__ == "__main__": " basically ensures that those lines will only be run by the main.py function
-- Whatever class you run, the __name__ is __main__. For all other classes, the __name__ is the file name.
